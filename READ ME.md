# Production Planning Data Analysis

In today's fast-paced business environment, effective production planning is crucial for organizations to meet customer demands efficiently. Production planning involves creating a roadmap that outlines the necessary activities to produce a product or service, considering available resources, timelines, and other relevant factors.

The purpose of this project is to analyze production planning data for four-line sections: LC Sec 1, LC Sec 2, LC Sec 3, and LC Sec 4, covering different periods. The data is provided in 49 files, each containing planning data for a specific time period and line section. By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into the performance of the line sections and identify areas for improvement.

The production planning data provides information on various aspects of the production process, including the number of units produced, the quantity of raw materials used, and the time taken for each task. Analyzing this data allows us to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the production process and take appropriate steps to address them. For instance, we may discover that a particular line section consistently falls behind schedule, indicating potential issues with resource allocation or task scheduling.

In this report, we will perform data analysis to identify trends, patterns, anomalies, and outliers in the production planning data. Additionally, we will explore correlations between different variables, such as the quantity of raw materials used and the number of units produced.

The findings of this analysis will be presented in this report, along with recommendations for enhancing the production planning process. These recommendations may involve resource allocation adjustments, task scheduling improvements, or the implementation of new tools and technologies to streamline the production process. The ultimate goal is to assist the organization in improving its production planning process, ensuring timely and efficient delivery to meet customer needs.

## Evaluation of Prediction Models
The results columns in the production planning dataset contain the output of the prediction models applied to the input features. These columns are essential for evaluating the performance and accuracy of the models in predicting the target variable. The specific results columns may vary based on the type of production planning problem, encompassing continuous values, binary values, or categorical values.

The results of the algorithm shown in Figure 7 demonstrate that all the applied algorithms achieved an accuracy of 0.8 or higher. This level of accuracy indicates the effectiveness of the algorithms in predicting the target variable and is considered favorable.

Please note that the accuracy of the prediction models and the subsequent analysis are based on the available dataset and the assumptions made during the analysis process. It is advisable to consider additional sources, expert knowledge, and further investigation when making decisions or drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

This project is intended for educational and informational purposes, aiming to showcase the application of data analysis techniques to production planning data.
